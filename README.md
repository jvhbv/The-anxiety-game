ya know what? I've been thinking that I want a very particular video game. I don't really know how to put it into words but I want it to accurately portray depression without going over the top,
 have a bittersweet ending without death... or with it depending on how bad the depression is, but I don't want a visual novel or something.
 I sort of want something like a walking-dead telltale games style game. hmm.. this is hard to explain without sounding like I just want ddlc but telltale games. 
I sort of want it so all the characters besides the main character (the depressed one) look like shadowy figures, but still remain human enough to be realistic. 
hot damn this is hard to put into words. I want it to give you choices that show how anxiety and stuff works. Like for example, it'll give you a choice to talk to someone or not and 
if you say no, then obviously you don't, but if you say yes, you'll walk up to them and have a mini panic attack and end up just saying something like "What's up?"
 I want it so that if someone walks up to you and initiates a conversation, you can choose what to say, but all the options are very brief and seem as if you 
are just trying to end the conversation, unless the person addressing you is someone you have been friends for a long time with. idk, just a random idea I came up with.
If you are interested in helping develop the game or have ideas about it, feel free send a pull request.
